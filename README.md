# denbosHerbarium
In this game, you are Denbo, a quirky little garden gnome that lives in the Denver Botanic Gardens. You keep a tidy home along with your pet cricket Maury. But you don't just putter around all day...you are a botanist! To aid with your studies, you have built your very own little herbarium, filled with specimens you've collected from the Gardens.
